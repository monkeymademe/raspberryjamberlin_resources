A handy collection of inputs and outputs

You can invent lots of cool little projects using the on-board button, lightsand speaker.When you want to get more advanced you can attach your own inputsand outputs to Pibrella to extend your projects.It even has a USB power connector so it can deliver more juice to motors,relays and solenoids connected to the outputs.With LED indicators on all of the inputs and outputs it makes debuggingyour projects a breeze...
