#Skill Bagdes
Skill badges are a collection of lists of todo's based around a single theme. device or add-on around the Raspberry Pi.

The consept is that a user would want to gain a skill badge for the Pibrella add-on board (as an example). They then find a list of tasks to complete with limited instuction. Once finished they can claim their badge.

The badges should only offer a limited instuction (example links to the user manual) so the user can go out and find for them selfs how to complete the task.

Users offten faced with an add-on board ask what it does and then leaves the board alone without even using it. Motovation is low to work it out when they can't imagine what they could use it for.

Skill Badges ofer them a guide to using these devices and both a way its designed for and possibly encorrage more creative ways.
 
Finally Skill Badges could provide a working path in learning. Example: If you want to learn to build a basic robot the following skill badges would need to be obtained 1st - Raspberry Pi setup, pibrella, motor control, python.

Following is a list of skill badges.
